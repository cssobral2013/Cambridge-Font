# Cambridge Sans and Sans Mono
Is custom-compiled from Iosevka.
The compiled TTF's are on /dist folder.
Main changes include: alternates based off of Aper√ßu Mono, tightened spacing (especially in Sans, where alternates were
criteriously selected to reduce spacing waste to minimum), and changed italic angle to 15-degree.
